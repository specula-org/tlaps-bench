# Validate a TLA+ inductive invariant

Use a model checker to falsify a candidate invariant before investing in its TLAPS proof. Treat a successful finite check as evidence only: prove the invariant in TLAPS, and finish with the benchmark's authoritative `check_proof_bin` command.

## Run the three Apalache checks

Shape the candidate as `IndInv == TypeOK /\ H`, where `TypeOK` contains one finite-domain membership clause for every variable and `H` contains the additional facts needed for induction. Given a target module `Target`, a typed wrapper `APTarget.tla`, and a safety predicate `Safety`, run:

```sh
apalache-mc check --config=APTarget.cfg --init=Init --inv=IndInv --length=0 APTarget.tla
apalache-mc check --config=APTarget.cfg --init=IndInv --inv=IndInv --length=1 APTarget.tla
apalache-mc check --config=APTarget.cfg --init=IndInv --inv=Safety --length=0 APTarget.tla
```

Interpret these checks as:

1. `Init => IndInv`: legitimate initial states satisfy the candidate.
2. `IndInv /\ Next => IndInv'`: one step preserves the candidate.
3. `IndInv => Safety`: the candidate is strong enough to prove the goal.

The checks starting from `--init=IndInv` require the candidate to assign every variable. A bare safety predicate can instead produce an assignment error such as `x' is used before it is assigned`. Write the missing `TypeOK` if the stripped target has none. Bound `Nat`-typed values to small finite sets, for example `num \in [P -> 0..4]`, and widen a bound before trusting a counterexample that may depend on it.

When a check fails, read the counterexample. Apalache writes `violation1.tla` in a timestamped directory under `_apalache-out/<module>.tla/` unless redirected with `--out-dir` or `--run-dir`; the `Check the trace in: ...` log line gives the exact path.

- A failure of the first check means the candidate excludes a legitimate initial state.
- A failure of the second check gives a state satisfying `IndInv` and a successor violating it. The trailing `InvariantViolation` formula identifies the broken conjunct and usually exposes the fact missing from `H`.
- A failure of the third check means the candidate does not imply the safety goal.

Strengthen or correct the candidate from the trace, then rerun all three checks.

## Build a non-invasive Apalache wrapper

Keep tool-specific annotations out of `Target.tla`. Re-declare its constants and variables with Apalache types in a separate wrapper, then instantiate the target:

```tla
---- MODULE APTarget ----
EXTENDS Naturals

CONSTANT
  \* @type: Int;
  N

VARIABLE
  \* @type: Set(Int);
  active

INSTANCE Target

TypeOK == active \in SUBSET (0..N)
H == TRUE
IndInv == TypeOK /\ H

====
```

Match every re-declared name exactly so implicit `INSTANCE` substitution binds it. Put each `\* @type:` annotation between the `CONSTANT` or `VARIABLE` keyword and the name it annotates, including every name originally declared in a multi-name block. A comment above the keyword is not accepted and leads to `Expected a type annotation for VARIABLE <name>`.

Define `IndInv` in the wrapper. Fix finite constants in `APTarget.cfg`, for example:

```tla
INIT Init
NEXT Next

CONSTANT N = 5
```

Alternatively, use `--cinit`. For an uninterpreted constant, define a finite value operator such as `JugVal` in the wrapper and substitute it with `Jug <- JugVal` in the configuration. If a polymorphic helper such as `Sum`, `Range`, or `ToSet` defeats type checking, shadow it in the wrapper with a monomorphic version.

Only if the wrapper cannot be made to typecheck, annotate a private scratch copy:

```sh
mkdir -p scratch
cp Target.tla scratch/Candidate.tla
```

Never make the submitted solution extend or instantiate the wrapper or scratch module. Do not alter the target or any dependency as part of model-checking exploration.

## Fall back to TLC

Use TLC when Apalache cannot type the target through a wrapper. Create a separate `MCTarget.tla` that extends `Target` and defines `TypeOK`, `H`, and `IndInv`, with `MCTarget.cfg` beside it. TLC is not on `PATH`; run:

```sh
java -cp /opt/sany/lib/tla2tools.jar tlc2.TLC -deadlock -config MCTarget.cfg MCTarget.tla
```

Check the inductive step by making the candidate its own initial predicate:

```tla
INIT IndInv
NEXT Next
INVARIANT IndInv
```

This checks `IndInv /\ Next => IndInv'` because `IndInv` is an ordinary invariant of the specification started in `IndInv`. Check `Init => IndInv` separately on the real specification with `SPECIFICATION Spec` and `INVARIANT IndInv`. Include `Safety` as a conjunct of `IndInv` to check that the candidate implies it.

Use the same enumerable `TypeOK /\ H` shape as for Apalache. TLC first builds the states satisfying `TypeOK` and then filters them with `H`, so start with the smallest useful model. To reduce enumeration:

- Move a conjunct of `H` immediately after the `TypeOK` clauses that bind the variables it mentions, allowing TLC to prune earlier.
- Sample large domains with `RandomSubset(k, S)` from the `Randomization` module. Rewrite `v \subseteq W` as `v \in SUBSET W` and sample it with `RandomSetOfSubsets(k, p, W)`.

Aim for a few dozen initial states. A TLC violation supplies the same useful two-state signal as Apalache. Once random sampling is involved, a run with no violation proves nothing; rerun it about a dozen times and abandon a run whose search depth grows beyond roughly a dozen steps.

See Leslie Lamport's [Using TLC to Check Inductive Invariance](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/inductive-invariant.pdf) for the TLC technique.

Never cite an Apalache or TLC verdict as justification for a TLAPS proof step.
