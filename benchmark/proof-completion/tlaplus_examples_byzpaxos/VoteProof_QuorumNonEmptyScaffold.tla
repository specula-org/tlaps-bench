(***************************************************************************)
(* This is a high-level consensus algorithm in which a set of processes    *)
(* called `acceptors' cooperatively choose a value.  The algorithm uses    *)
(* numbered ballots, where a ballot is a round of voting.  Acceptors cast  *)
(* votes in ballots, casting at most one vote per ballot.  A value is      *)
(* chosen when a large enough set of acceptors, called a `quorum', have    *)
(* all voted for the same value in the same ballot.                        *)
(*                                                                         *)
(* Ballots are not executed in order.  Different acceptors may be          *)
(* concurrently performing actions for different ballots.                  *)

(***************************************************************************)
(* The following assumption asserts that a quorum is a set of acceptors,   *)
(* and the fundamental assumption we make about quorums: any two quorums   *)
(* have a non-empty intersection.                                          *)
