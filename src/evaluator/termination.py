"""Classify how an agent run terminated — in particular, whether a benchmark
result is trustworthy or was cut short by INFRA_ERROR.

A benchmark verdict (PASS/FAIL) is a capability signal only if the agent
actually got to make a genuine attempt. When the run is cut short by
infrastructure — a corrupted/refused API request, a dropped stream, a server
overload — the resulting FAIL says nothing about the model. We tag such runs
with ``termination_reason = INFRA_ERROR`` so they can be filtered out (and
auto-retried by the runner when the model did no work) instead of being read
as genuine failures.

:func:`classify` first checks for a wall-clock timeout (a backend-independent
LIMIT — the model was working, it just ran out of time — reported as TIMEOUT,
never INFRA_ERROR), then runs a registry of INFRA RULES (criteria). Each rule
inspects a ``TerminationContext`` and returns a reason if it fires, else
``None``; the first that fires wins. There is one rule per backend
(:func:`codex_turn_failed`, :func:`claude_code_result_error`,
:func:`copilot_session_error`, :func:`litellm_completion_error`), each branching
on ``ctx.backend`` to read its own event vocabulary, plus one backend-independent startup rule
(:func:`agent_startup_failure`) for the CLI dying before emitting a single
event. The one-shot rule may also return TIMEOUT for a strictly audited
provider deadline. Add more by appending to :data:`INFRA_RULES`.

This module only CLASSIFIES. Acting on the classification (the runner auto-
retries an INFRA_ERROR run whose model did no work) is left to the caller.
