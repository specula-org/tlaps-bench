"""Score benchmark results from one or more results.json files.

``tlaps-bench run`` writes a machine-readable ``results.json`` per run. This
reads one or more of them and prints a Markdown scorecard. It is pure and
offline — no network, no API keys — so metrics can be (re)computed cheaply
without re-running the (expensive) agents.

PASS/FAIL: a task counts as passed iff its ``check_verdict`` is exactly
``"PASS"``. Every other verdict — FAIL, CHEATING, TIMEOUT, ERROR — counts as
not passed. CHEATING is not a separate category here: a cheat is just a failure.

SKIP is one exception: an operator marks a benchmark ``SKIP`` to exclude it from
scoring (e.g. a theorem known to time out for reasons outside the agent's
control). A skipped task is in neither the numerator nor the denominator — it is
dropped from the pass rate entirely, not counted as a failure — and the count is
reported separately so nothing is hidden.

Non-genuine runs are the other exception: a result whose ``termination_reason``
is ``INFRA_ERROR`` or ``QUOTA_EXHAUSTED`` was cut short by infrastructure or a
provider cap, so the verdict is not a capability signal. These are excluded from
the numerator and denominator — like SKIP — and reported separately as needing a
re-run. TIMEOUT is a limit, not infrastructure: the agent worked and is graded on
what it left in the workspace, so it stays scored.

Continuations (``tlaps-bench run --max-continuations``) are a separate metric,
never a replacement: ``check_verdict`` always holds the FIRST attempt's verdict,
so the pass rate above stays pass@1. When a run recorded continuation rounds
(``result["continuations"]``), a second, clearly-labeled "with continuations"
rate is reported (with the run's ≤N budget), counting a task as passed if any
round reached PASS — the gap between the two is how often a first-attempt
failure was an early stop rather than an inability. A chain cut short by
infra/quota before resolving is interrupted, not failed: like a non-genuine
first attempt it is excluded from the continuation rate and reported separately
(see ``continuation_interrupted``).

For module-level proof-from-scratch results, the primary score is dependency-
closed proof-unit coverage: a module with k trusted original theorems out of n
scores k/n, preserving theorem-level partial credit. Strict whole-module
completion remains visible as a diagnostic. Other modes retain the strict
specification pass rate as their primary score.

The legacy pluggable task scorer assigns a non-negative weight to each task;
the score of a group of tasks is

    100 * (sum of weights of passed tasks) / (sum of all weights)

The ``equal`` task scorer gives every task weight 1. It remains available via
``--scoring equal`` for compatibility and as the task-micro diagnostic.
