"""Generate proof-from-scratch benchmarks from source .tla files.

Core principle (strict mode, from src/dataset/proof_from_scratch/design.md, Issue #1/#3):
  Keep only what is needed to STATE the top-level theorem; delete every
  other definition, all other theorems/lemmas, all proof content, and all
  comments. The AI must rediscover the inductive invariant and design the
  proof structure from scratch.

For each top-level THEOREM in source/<Module>/<File>.tla we emit one
file benchmark/proof-from-scratch/<Module>/<File>_<TheoremName>.tla in which:
  - The module + EXTENDS + CONSTANT/VARIABLE/ASSUME/AXIOM are kept.
  - Only the `==` definitions / named INSTANCE bindings reachable from the
    target theorem's STATEMENT (transitive closure over the definition-
    dependency graph, seeded by the statement + kept ASSUME/AXIOM) survive;
    unreachable ones (inductive invariants like `Inv`/`TypeOK`, helper
    operators like `SafeAt`/`MsgInv`) are deleted as proof artifacts.
    When the goal IS an invariant (`Spec => []Inv`), that invariant is in
    the statement, so it is reachable and kept — the goal can't be hidden.
  - All other THEOREMs and all LEMMAs (statement + proof) are deleted.
  - The target THEOREM's proof body is replaced with `PROOF OBVIOUS`.
  - All comments (`\\*` line, `(* … *)` block) are stripped.
  - Dep .tla files (EXTENDS, or kept INSTANCEs) are copied alongside with
    their proofs stripped (`PROOF OMITTED`) and comments stripped.

Top-level selection (OR rule, applied to THEOREM-keyword decls only):
  1. Unnamed rule: T has no name (TLA+ syntax can't reference it → standalone).
  2. Shape rule:   statement is `<S> => ...` where `<S>` is a spec formula.
  3. Graph rule:   T has a name and no other theorem references it.

Post-selection filters:
  A. Manual-proof filter: drop candidates whose source has no structured
     TLAPS proof (bare statement / PROOF OMITTED / PROOF OBVIOUS). proof-from-scratch's
     contract is "AI writes a proof, compared against a human reference",
     so candidates without ground truth are out of scope for now.
     Known cost: PaxosTuple.tla:79 `Spec => V!Spec` (proof lives in the
     companion file PaxosProof.tla) and PConProof.tla:520
     `Spec => [](chosen = V!chosen)` (model-checked by TLC, no TLAPS
     proof written). Both are genuine main theorems; they can be revived
     later in a separate "no-reference-proof" track if we ever want it.
  A'. Known-false filter: drop a top-level theorem whose goal TLC has shown
     to be FALSE, even though the source "proves" it via an OMITTED sub-step
     that papers over the gap (e.g. PaxosProof StructOK3). A false goal admits
     no honest proof, so it cannot be a benchmark. This is now the ONLY reason
     an OMITTED-sub-step theorem is dropped: every other such theorem is a
     published/verified result and is KEPT as a (hard) from-scratch benchmark,
     since proof-from-scratch grades by tlapm rather than by the human reference proof.
     See KNOWN_FALSE_TARGETS for the per-target TLC evidence.
  B. Within-file dedup: collapse exact-text-duplicate statements. Catches
     Peterson.tla L124/L134/L183 — three identical
     `THEOREM Spec => []MutualExclusion` decls the author wrote to
     showcase different prover backends; as proof-from-scratch prompts they are
     indistinguishable, so keep the first by line.
  C. Cross-directory dedup: across all output directories, collapse
     byte-identical target benchmarks. Catches the seven `Sets_*.tla`
     pairs that arise because source/Consensus/Sets.tla and
     source/Data/Sets.tla are near-identical copies of the same
     utility library (only two prover-hint lines differ, both inside
     proof bodies that proof-from-scratch strips, so the emitted proof-from-scratch prompts are
     byte-identical). When duplicates are detected, the copy under
     `Data/` is kept (utility libraries are at home in `Data/`); the
     copies in other directories are removed and the audit log records
     each drop. Dep files (e.g. `Sets.tla` itself, copied alongside
     targets) are not subject to this pass — they may legitimately need
     to live in multiple directories because other targets in those
     directories depend on them.

Spec formulas are identified by SANY-AST shape (see src/dataset/sany-dump/),
not by name match. The audit log flags non-`Spec` names, zero specs,
multiple specs, multiple top-level theorems, unnamed top-levels, and
every drop made by filters A, B, and C.

Layered layout (`--layered`, Issue #64)
---------------------------------------
By default everything above lands in ONE editable module, so an agent can make
the theorem easier without proving the original obligation (redefine the target
property, weaken fairness). `--layered` instead splits each task by ownership so
the obligation is immutable by construction:

    <base>Model.tla    declarations, assumptions, state machine, Spec, fairness
    <task>Defs.tla     EXTENDS the model; only this target's given definitions
    <task>.tla         EXTENDS its Defs; the theorem, the markers, the proof

Only `<task>.tla` is editable, and within it only the two marked regions:

    \\* BEGIN AGENT HELPERS / \\* END AGENT HELPERS   fresh helper defs + lemmas
    \\* BEGIN AGENT PROOF   / \\* END AGENT PROOF     the proof

A suite-level `manifest.json` maps each task to the exact read-only modules
assigned to it, so the evaluator never infers context by copying siblings and
one task cannot inherit another task's target definitions. Each manifest entry
also records the originating source specification. The marker strings and
manifest schema are the contract in src/common/proof_from_scratch_contract.py;
the two must stay byte-compatible.

Only spec-goal targets extend the shared model; a pure lemma target keeps a
self-contained Defs layer with just the declarations it uses.
