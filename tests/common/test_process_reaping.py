"""Timeout cleanup — `run_killgroup` must kill tlapm's escaped backends.

tlapm's Isabelle backend `setsid`s into its own session, so `killpg` alone
leaves polyml and any z3 it holds running. The reaper snapshots the PPid chain
before killing, which needs a portable `pid -> ppid` source.

Run: PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m pytest tests/common/test_process_reaping.py
